                           The evaluation involved interviews and focus groups with parents, teachers, human factors experts and other groups.


                        
                        
                           
                           The findings offered broad support for the guidelines and some revisions.


                        
                        
                           
                           The paper concludes with a set of recommendations for future work (e.g., the need for behavioral testing).
