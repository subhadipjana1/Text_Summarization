                           The two designs compared were a bent-shaft shovel and a straight-shaft shovel.


                        
                        
                           
                           L5/S1 extension angular impulses were lower in the bent-shaft condition.


                        
                        
                           
                           This occurred due to reduced extension moment duration, reduced extension moment magnitude and reduced upper body flexion.
