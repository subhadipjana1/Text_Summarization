                      shows the main results for this study. Fig. 3 shows the mean moment–time curves and Fig. 4
                      shows the mean upper body flexion angle curves. The areas beneath the moment–time curves represent the angular impulses. L5/S1 extension angular impulses were significantly decreased with bent-shaft shovel use (p = 0.022). Specifically, the bent-shaft shovel reduced the L5/S1 extension angular impulse by 16.5% compared to the straight-shaft shovel. Seven of eight subjects experienced reduced extension impulses with the bent-shaft shovel. Trial-to-trial variability for extension impulse values for each subject was typically ±15%.

Total trial time was not significantly different between shovel conditions (p = 0.649; mean of 2.93 s for bent-shaft, mean of 2.86 for straight shaft); however, a trend existed (Fig. 4) where extension moment duration was reduced with the bent-shaft shovel (p = 0.077; extension moment for 77.5% of cycle in bent-shaft condition; extension moment for 85.6% of cycle in straight-shaft condition).

Peak L5/S1 extension moments were significantly reduced with the bent shaft shovel (p = 0.044) (Fig. 4). Additionally, the peak upper body flexion angle was reduced with the bent-shaft shovel (p = 0.002) (Fig. 5
                     ). Peak upper body flexion angle was significantly correlated with peak L5/S1 moment magnitude (r = 0.70, p = 0.0024).
