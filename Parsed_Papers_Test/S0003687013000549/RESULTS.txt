The wrist was on average extended 21.8 (±8.9) degrees in the extended (EXT) condition, adducted 20.8 (±3.8) degrees in the adducted (ADD) condition, and flexed 18.5 (±10.9) degrees in the FLX condition (Table 3
                     ), all significantly different from the wrist posture in the neutral (NTL) condition (Tukey test p < 0.0001). MCP joint flexion angle in ADD condition was less than other conditions. MCP adducted 3.4 (±7.0) degrees in FLX condition while abducted in other conditions. Mean wrist extension torque was larger during tapping in NTL and FLX configurations compared to ADD and EXT (Table 3). Mean wrist adduction torque did not differ among conditions. The maximum vertical fingertip force during tapping in flexed wrist posture (1.58 ± 0.37 N) was higher than other conditions, although no statistical difference was found among conditions.

Estimated muscle stresses varied temporally during a typical tap (Fig. 2
                     ). Finger flexor (FDS and FDP) stresses increased shortly after the contact with the key switch, peaked around the point of maximum fingertip force, and gradually decreased afterwards. Finger extensor (LE) stress decreased before the finger-key contact, remained low during contact and increased after the contact. The stress of intrinsic muscle UI had a similar temporal pattern as the flexors but greater in magnitude while RI and LUM stress were low throughout the tap. Muscle stresses of wrist extensors ECR and ECU peaked at the time of keystroke and remained higher than 4.5 N/cm² during the tap. Wrist flexors FCR and FCU stresses were lower than 0.5 N/cm² throughout the whole duration of a tap. These patterns were similar among different conditions and across subjects.

Forearm extensor stress averaged across the taps varied among the four wrist postures (Table 4
                     ) for both the passive (p < 0.0001 for LE, ECR, and ECU) and the active component (p = 0.01, 0.08, and <0.0001 for LE, ECR, and ECU, respectively). The total muscle stress (sum of passive and active muscle force) varied for ECU (p < 0.0001) and LE (p = 0.003) and ECR (p = 0.06) among four experimental conditions. The passive stress of the wrist extensors (ECR and ECU) were less than 0.4 N/cm², while the active components were greater than 1.5 N/cm². The highest total muscle forces of three extensors occurred in the flexed wrist posture.

The total muscle stresses of the flexors (FDS, FDP, FCR, and FCU) were smaller than the extensors stresses (Table 4). The passive components but not the active components of flexor stress were affected by the wrist posture during tapping (p < 0.0001). The extended wrist posture was associated with the highest passive flexor stresses, while the flexed wrist posture was associated with the lowest passive flexor stresses. For the hand intrinsic muscles, the total muscle stress for UI showed total stress of more than 3.0 N/cm² while RI and LUM stresses were less than 0.8 N/cm². The highest total muscle forces of three intrinsic muscles occurred in the adducted wrist posture.
