                           Neutral wrist posture was the optimal option among four tested wrist postures when all muscles were considered.


                        
                        
                           
                           Extensor muscles exhibited higher muscle stresses than flexors.


                        
                        
                           
                           Wrist extensors stress remained higher than 4.5 N/cm² and wrist flexor stress remained below 0.5 N/cm² during tapping.
