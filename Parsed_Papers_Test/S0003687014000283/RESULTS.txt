The distribution of gender, vocational education, health, working condition and reduced demand-specific work ability for each age group is presented in Table 1.

In the group of 46-year old employees, 8–10% of the participants often or always had difficulty making quick decisions, working with customers, patients, or students/pupils, or working together with colleagues (Table 1). In this age-group 12.4% experienced difficulty remembering important things, 14.5% experienced difficulty managing the physical demands of work, and 15.5% experienced difficulty managing the pace of work. Almost one fifth of the 46-year old employees (19.3%) reported difficulty managing the amount of work.

In the group of 56-year old employees 10–12% of the participants often or always had difficulty making quick decisions, working with customers, patients or students/pupils, or working together with colleagues. In this age-group 14.1% experienced difficulty remembering important things, 16.3% experienced difficulty managing the pace of work, and 18.0% experienced difficulty managing the physical demands of work. More than one fifth of the 56-year old employees (21.4%) reported difficulty managing the amount of work.

The odds of difficulty making quick decisions and difficulty working together with colleagues were significantly increased among the 56-year old as compared with 46-years old (Table 2). Women had significantly lower odds of experiencing difficulty making quick decisions, remembering important things, working with costumers, patients, or students/pupils, and working together with colleagues (Table 2). Having no vocational education was associated with all measures of reduced demand-specific work ability and for all outcome measures the association was strongest in this exposure group (OR's ranging from 1.7 to 3.8). The most pronounced associations between length of vocational education and reduced demand-specific work ability were observed for difficulty managing physical job demands and making quick decisions and for difficulties working with costumers, patients, or students/pupils and working with colleagues.

In the fully adjusted model (Model III, Table 3), we found that MSP was significantly associated with difficulty managing the physical job demands, and the amount and pace of work, and with difficulty remembering important things with odds ratios ranging from 1.3 to 1.4. MD was significantly associated with all measures of demand-specific work ability except for the ability of working with customers, patients, or students/pupils with odds ratios ranging from 1.8 to 3.6. Thus, overall there appeared to be larger associations between MD and measures of reduced demand-specific work ability and additionally, MD was more often related to demand-specific work ability (six out of seven measures) than MSP (four out of seven measures).

In the fully adjusted model (Model III, Table 3), we also found a strong association between demand-specific work ability and high physical job demands (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.6–2.7), demands to accomplish high amounts of work (OR = 5.1; 95% CI: 4.2–6.2), and high demands to work fast (OR = 2.3; 95% CI: 1.9–2.8). Additionally, we found a moderate association between demand-specific work ability and high demands to make quick decisions (OR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.2–2.0) and high emotional demands (OR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1–2.0).

We found that the combination of MSP/MD and job demands/social support was not associated with more frequent reporting of reduced demand-specific work ability than expected from the product of the individual effects of job demands and health problems (i.e. p for multiplicative interaction >0.05; data not shown in tables). Only in one case our analyses showed a significant interaction between job demands (emotional demands) and poor health (MSP) (p = 0.013). The interaction worked in the opposite direction than hypothesized: The combination of high emotional demands and MSP was associated with lower odds of reduced demand-specific work ability (i.e. difficulty working with costumers, patients, or students/pupils) than expected from the product of the individual effects of high emotional demands and MSP. The test for additive interaction showed the same results as the test for multiplicative interaction: Only high emotional demands and daily MSP interacted significantly (RERI = −1.1; 95% CI: −2.0 to −0.2; data not shown in tables).
