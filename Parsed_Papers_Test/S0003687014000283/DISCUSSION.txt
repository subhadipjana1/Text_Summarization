In conclusion, we found that middle-aged full-time employees reported most difficulty managing the physical demands and difficulty managing the amount of work and pace of work. In general, there was only small to moderate differences between age groups and gender with respect to reduced demand-specific work ability and in general shorter vocational education was associated with higher odds of reduced demands-specific work ability.

MD had larger associations with reduced demand-specific work ability than MSP. However, both MSP and MD were related to difficulty managing physical job demands, difficulty managing the amount and pace of work, and difficulty remembering important things. Furthermore, MD was associated with difficulty making quick decisions and difficulty working together with colleagues. Thus, the associations between poor health and reduced demand-specific work ability were less specific than we hypothesized.

This study did not confirm an interaction between working conditions and poor health with regard to demand-specific work ability, i.e. high job demands or low social support did not appear to increase the association between poor health and reduced demand-specific work ability.
