Traffic signs play a vital role in creating a safer environment for drivers, bikers, and pedestrians. Although inanimate bicycle signs have been the standard for over 30 years, this study confirms that animate bicycle symbols should be considered in the redesign of bicycling facility signs. This study's findings—particularly if they are tested in actual driving situations—may justify the need to incorporate animate bicycle designs in signage with the goal of enhancing the safety of drivers and bicyclists alike.
