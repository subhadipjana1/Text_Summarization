Driver preference was assessed by combining driver hand placement and anthropometric data. In past studies that investigated driver hand placement in a naturalistic setting, no anthropometric data were measured. Anthropometric data were compared between groups using t tests (
                           α
                         = 0.05) and trends found by using correlations. Driver hand placements were assessed qualitatively by overlaying translucent markers and then categorically to assess common locations. Hand placement was compared across vehicles and groups with descriptive data, using the same categories as Jonsson's study (2011). Drivers with atypical hand placement were grouped and compared to typical hand placement with t tests.

Grip design was assessed using rank orders of the four steering wheels, and Likert scales were correlated between groups and between vehicles. It should be noted that when testing for mean differences using the T or F statistic, if homogeneity was violated, the Satterthwaite approximation was used.

To compare the Baby Boomers and Generation-Y groups, independent samples t tests were conducted on the participants' hand measurements, body height, and preferred dowel size. The results showed no statistically significant differences on any of the five hand measurements, body height, or dowel size. Because there were no significant differences between groups for the hand measurements and body height, the groups were combined, and a correlation matrix was calculated to examine relationships between the hand and body height measurements and dowel size preference. See Table 1
                           . No significant correlations were found between hand measurements and dowel size preference. However, many of the hand measurements were correlated with body height. Body height was significantly correlated with dowel size, r = 0.359, p < 0.05. Notably, the most frequently preferred dowel size was 3.175 cm; 18 participants selected this size. Seven participants chose the 3.81 cm diameter dowel; four chose 2.8575 cm; two chose 4.445 cm; one chose 2.54 cm; and none chose 2.225 cm or 5.08 cm.

For the data where participants were asked to grip the steering wheel in the most comfortable location during the in-vehicle segment of the study, each data point (i.e., dot) was made translucent and overlaid onto a common background. See Fig. 3
                           .

A total of five participants (3 Generation-Y, 2 Baby Boomer) indicated in at least one vehicle that the most comfortable way to grip the steering wheel was with only one hand. Of these five participants, three used one hand on more than one vehicle. Table 2
                            highlights the percentage of several grip locations across both groups and all vehicles. Five (3 Generation-Y, 2 Baby Boomer) of the 32 participants used an asymmetrical hand arrangement on at least one vehicle. Two of those five had an asymmetrical hand arrangement on more than one vehicle. One participant used both asymmetrical and one-handed grip arrangements. Five participants (3 Generation-Y, 2 Baby Boomer) gripped the steering wheel on the lower half at least once. All five of these gripped the wheel on the lower half in more than one vehicle. (One of these participants used a mixed configuration where one hand was on the top of the wheel and the other on the bottom of the wheel where the left hand was on the lower half of the wheel and the right hand on the top half.)

Participants who exhibited any of the atypical hand placement locations (n = 12) were separated into one group and compared to participants who placed both hands, symmetrically, on the top of the steering wheel (n = 20). Hand measurements, body height and dowel size preference were compared between groups. Neither the hand measurements nor dowel size preferences were significantly different between groups, but body height was significantly different, t(27.78) = −2.285, p < 0.05. Participants who gripped the steering wheel in a manner that was not symmetrical and on the top part of the wheel were significantly shorter (M = 177.28 cm) in body height than participants who gripped the wheel symmetrically on top (M = 181.74 cm).

Referencing photographs of vehicle steering wheels, participants were asked to rank order the steering wheels from most preferred (1) to least preferred (4). See Table 3
                           . Generation-Y participants ranked the Mazda RX-8 as first preference (38%) more than Baby Boomers (6%). Baby Boomers ranked the BMW 530XI as first preference (81%) more than Generation-Y participants (56%). There were no significant differences between the Generation-Y and Baby Boomer groups for all other rankings.

Vehicle steering wheels were compared using the seven Likert scale ratings (soft/firm, pliable/stiff, fitting/nonfitting, etc.) between groups (Generation-Y and Baby Boomers). Generation-Y ranked the BMW 530XI as more cheap than Baby Boomers, t(30) = 2.181, p < .05 (Baby Boomers M = 2.19, Generation-Y M = 3.31). Generation-Y ranked the Mazda Miata as smoother than Baby Boomers, t(27.287) = 2.110, p < 0.05 (Baby Boomers M = 4.33, Generation-Y M = 5.56). Generation-Y ranked the Mazda2 as more soft than Baby Boomers, t(30) = −2.374, p < .05 (Baby Boomers M = 6.06, Generation-Y M = 4.94). There were no significant differences between groups for the Mazda RX-8. Correlations between Likert scale rankings for each car and each group are shown in Tables 4
