                           Significant discrepancies in the preferred walking direction depending on pedestrians'dominant hand and foot exist.


                        
                        
                           
                           Left-handed and footed pedestrians are more likely to the Left-hand Traffic rules, while right-handed and footed are on the right side.


                        
                        
                           
                           The dominant hand appears to have a greater impact on the pedestrian's preferred walking direction than the dominant foot.
