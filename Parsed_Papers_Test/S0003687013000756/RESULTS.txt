As demonstrated in Table 3
                        , 59.3% of the 1000 pedestrians who were observed in the first phase of the study walked on the left side, while 40.7% walked on the right.

As shown in Table 4
                        , of the six hundred respondents in the second phase of the study, 64.9% preferred walking on the right side across different walking locations, supporting the implementation of Right-side Traffic rules (Table 4). As for the preferred walking direction in different locations by gender, no statistical significance was found from the Chi-squared test (p > .05).

Besides the statistical analysis on walking directions by gender, each age group was also analyzed to investigate any patterns or characteristics among the stratification variables. The results showed that all age groups preferred walking on the right in all locations, as shown in Table 5
                        .

As for the preferred walking direction in different locations by age group, no statistical significance was found from the Chi-squared test, same as walking characteristics by gender, except for the roads with no boundaries between roadways and sidewalks (p = .019).

Of the six hundred respondents who participated in the current research, 460 (76.7%) were right-handed, 63 (10.5%) left-handed and 77 (12.8%) ambidextrous. Analyzed by gender and age group, males were relatively more prone to be left-handed or ambidextrous, while females were more likely to be right-handed. However, no significant discrepancies were found across different age groups. The results from the ANOVA test showed no statistical significance for gender (p = .073), age (p = .487), or interaction effects (p = .416).

Of the 92 (15.3%) left-footed respondents, the number of males was 56 (9.3%), relatively higher than that of females, 36 (6.0%), similar to the tendencies found in dominant hands. The results from the Chi-squared tests also showed a significant effect (p = .023). Nonetheless, the differences of dominant foot by age group were not significant. The results from the ANOVA test did not show significant effects of age groups (p = .508) or interaction effects between gender and age group (p = .174).

In regard to pedestrians' preferences depending on their dominant hand, Table 6
                         shows that of all the survey respondents, 5.7% were left-handed and preferred walking on the left side, which was higher percentage than the 4.8% who were left-handed and preferred walking on the right side. In other words, 54.3% of the left-handed preferred walking on the left side while 45.7% of the left-handed preferred walking on the right side. As for the ambidextrous respondents, 4.3% of the respondents, or 33.6% of the ambidextrous, preferred walking on the left, significantly lower than the 8.5% of the respondents, or 66.4% of the ambidextrous, who preferred the right side. Not surprisingly, 51.6% of the respondents who were right-handed, or 67.3% of the right-handed, preferred walking on the right side, significantly higher than the 25.1%, or 32.7% of the right-handed, who preferred the left side.

Similar to the findings about the dominant hand, of all the survey respondents, 7.9% were left-footed and preferred walking on the left side, slightly higher than the 7.4% who were left-footed and preferred walking on the right side. In other words, 51.6% of the left-footed preferred walking on the left side whereas 48.3% of the left-footed preferred walking on the right side. As found in right-handed respondents, 57.5% of the respondents that were right-footed (or 32.1% of the right-footed) preferred walking on the right side, twice of the 27.2% of the respondents (or 67.9% of total right-footed) who were right-footed and preferred walking on the left side.

The results from the Chi-squared test for the effects of the dominant hand and foot in different locations are shown in Table 6. The dominant hand showed statistical significance in all selected locations, except for crossroads, whereas the dominant foot was significant in all selected locations except for crossroads, walking downstairs and exiting elevators.

Of the six hundred respondents surveyed, regardless of the walking locations, 158 (26.3%) preferred walking on the left side while 442 (73.7%) preferred the right side (Table 7
                        ).


                        Table 8
                         shows the relationships between the dominant hand and foot and their effects on walking directions. The results indicate that the combinations of the left dominant hand with the left dominant foot (7.7%), ambidextrous with the right dominant foot (10%), or the right dominant hand with the right dominant foot (72%) were higher than the other way around. Regarding the preferred walking direction, respondents preferred walking on the right side (56%) except for those with left dominant hand and foot (4.3%).

Of the six hundred respondents in the current research, 411 (68.5%) supported the shift to the Right-side Traffic policy.

Roads that do not indicate traffic directions or post signs commonly found in walking trails and riverside sidewalks are prone to cause transport inconveniences among joggers, bikers and in-line skaters. The current study surveyed different sports groups and clubs in order to examine their preferred moving direction. Results suggested that in-line skater club members preferred Right-side Traffic rules, while biking club members were riding on the right side, as stipulated by Article 2 Section 16 of the traffic law that states bicycles by definition are included in the ‘vehicle’ category, and are therefore required to abide by the Right-side Traffic policies. Joggers also advocated the Right-side Traffic rules, while climbers did not show a particular preference, as mountains drastically differ from lands in that unified left/right walking rules are not as applicable because walking directions could alternate depending on the other climbers coming from the opposite direction and the location of the ropes the climbers hold onto.

The current research observed 1000 Korean pedestrians, whose walking directions were observed. An additional six hundred respondents participated in a survey that examined their preferred walking direction at different public facilities commonly used on a daily basis. The following are a summary of the findings in this study.
                           
                              (1)
                              Before the amendment, the majority of pedestrians walked on the left side.

The majority of pedestrians preferred walking on the right side, regardless of the location.

No significant differences were found in the preferred walking direction by age or gender.

Significant discrepancies in the preferred walking direction depending on pedestrians' dominant hand and foot exist, with left-handed and footed pedestrians more inclined to the Left-hand Traffic rules, while right-handed and footed are more likely to walk on the right side. Additionally, the dominant hand appears to have a greater impact on the pedestrian's preferred walking direction than the dominant foot.

When asked for feedback on the proposed unification of walking directions, respondents expressed their preference for the Right-hand Traffic rules.

Regarding the current proposition to change walking directions from left to right, advocates outnumbered those in opposition, and younger generations (10s–20s) showed greater support towards the amendment.
