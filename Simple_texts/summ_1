Generic text summarization is a field that has seen increasing attention from the NLP community. The actual huge amount of electronic information has to be reduced to enable the users to handle this information more effectively. We mention here classes of summarization methods and a method based on LSA which has been recently published. We have further modified and improved this method. One of the most controversial parts of the summary research is its evaluation process. Next part of the article deals with possibilities of summary evaluation. We propose there two new evaluation methods based on LSA, which measure a content similarity between an original document and its summary. At the end of the paper we present evaluation results and further research directions.
