Pinch and power grip are essential indicators of hand function (Chaisson et al., 1999; Bagis et al., 2003). Gender, anthropometric factors and occupational loading have been found to affect grip strength which declines with age (Ranganathan et al., 2001a; Angst et al., 2010; Samuel et al., 2012). The impact of occupational hand loading on pinch grip strength is not well understood. Josty et al. (1997) found that heavy manual workers had the highest pinch grip strength, office workers the lowest, and light manual workers were between these two groups. In contrast, a history of manual work with high physical loading may lead to a decrease in hand strength (Russo et al., 2006). To our knowledge, no study has examined the effect of different types of dental work on hand function.

Dentists often perform repetitive work tasks with a high demand of precision and pinch force. The work tasks in dentistry differ with respect to mechanical loading on the finger joints (Milerad et al., 1991; Åkesson et al., 1997). Dentists heavily utilize the thumb, index, and middle fingers in precision gripping in the right (or dominant) hand, while the left hand remains static for supportive work tasks.

Chronic diseases affecting the hand may also lead to decreased pinch grip strength (Carmeli et al., 2003; Bagis et al., 2003). We have reported that symptomatic OA was associated with an increased risk of low pinch grip strength in middle aged women (Ding et al., 2010). A potential role of physical activity in attenuating the loss of grip strength has been suggested (Kjeken, 2011; Klum et al., 2012).

A correlation between anthropometric factors and pinch grip strength has been reported. In previous studies, hand length, palm length, and wrist and hand circumference were associated with hand grip strength (Anakwe et al., 2007; Li et al., 2010). A positive correlation was also observed between BMI and hand grip strength among overweight women (Ravisankar et al., 2005).

The objective of the present study was to investigate the association between variation in dental work task history and pinch grip strength among middle-aged female dentists. We assumed that low variation in dental work tasks is related to low pinch grip strength independently of symptomatic hand OA. As the right hand is more loaded than the left hand during dental work, we also assumed that the effect of low variation in work tasks on pinch grip strength will be more evident in the right hand than in the left. We further examined whether hand size, BMI and leisure-time hand-related physical activities might confound the potential association.

The subjects were randomly selected through the registers of the Finnish Dental Association, with aged 45–63 yrs in Helsinki and its neighbouring cities. Of those who received the questionnaire (in 2002), 295 (67.7%) dentists participated in a clinical examination between October 2002 and March 2003. Participation in the study was voluntary and based on informed consent. The Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa Ethics Committee for Research in Occupational Health and Safety approved the study proposal.

Tripoid pinch grip strength (later: pinch strength) of both hands was measured between the pulp of the thumb in opposition to the pulps of the index and middle fingers, using the Martin Vigorimeter® with a small ball. The Martin Vigorimeter is one of the instruments frequently used to assess grip strength in clinical and research settings (Mathiowetz et al., 1985; Hamilton et al., 1994; Haidar et al., 2004) The Vigorimeter showed good validity and reliability (Jones et al., 1991; Desrosiers et al., 1995).

The test was administered during the clinical examination session by a researcher trained for the purpose. The measurement was performed first on the right and then the left hand. The subjects were seated in a chair with back support, feet on the floor, and hands on the table in a neutral position. The elbow of the hand to be tested was fixed at 90°. The subjects received a verbal instruction to squeeze the ball as hard as they can. Subjects were asked to make two maximal contractions. If the second contraction was more than 10% higher or lower than the first, a third contraction was made. The highest reading was taken to represent the subject's pinch strength.

The unit of measurement was kilopascal (kPa). The lower 25th percentile of pinch grip strength (≤52 kPa) was used as the cut-off point to define low pinch strength of the left and the right hand. The great majority of the subjects were right-handed (eight persons, or 2.7%, were left-handed).

Both hands of the participants were radiographed. The analogue radiographs were evaluated by an experienced radiologist who was blinded to the age, and all health data of the subjects. Each distal interhalangeal (DIP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), thumb interphalangeal (IP), and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of both hands, and the wrists as a unit, were graded separately using a modified Kellgren and Lawrence scoring system with reference images (grade 0 = no OA; …, grade 4 = severe OA). The weighted intra-observer Kappa-coefficients of the readings varied from 0.59 to 1.00 indicating good reliability (Solovieva et al., 2005).

Information on pain in each joint was collected by a self-administered questionnaire, with the question: “Please point out in the picture below, in which finger joint did you feel pain or tenderness during the past 30 days”? The subject graded the joints with pain from 0 = never to 3 = severe on a figure of the hands.

In the current study, symptomatic hand OA, or jointwise co-occurrence of radiographic findings and pain, was defined as follows: the subject had both radiographic findings (grade ≥ 2) and pain (grade ≥ 1) in at least one corresponding joint in the 1st (thumb), 2nd (index), or 3rd (middle) finger or in the wrist. The reference group consisted of subjects without symptomatic hand OA in the first three fingers or in the wrist.

Based on a panel discussion with three experienced dentists and a professor in odontology, the main tasks in dentistry were listed and ranked by decade from the 1960s onwards, with respect to loading on the hands (0 = no load, …, 10 = maximum load). Changes in working techniques and instruments were also considered. Six main tasks in dental work were identified: (1) restorative treatment and endodontics, (2) orthodontics, (3) periodontics, (4) prosthodontics, (5) surgical treatment, and (6) other non-treatment activities (e.g. dental examination, consulting, and administrative tasks).

Information on dentist's work history was collected by questionnaires and checked by interview during clinical examination. The study participants were asked to recall their work history in 10-year periods (at the ages of 25–34, 35–44, and 45–54 yrs) in terms of average number of working hours per week, and the proportion of time (percentage) they performed each task during an average working day. A matrix of workload coefficients for different tasks and time periods has been reported previously (Vehmas et al., 2005). Dental filling and root treatment was ranked as highest loading task among all dental work tasks.

Based on the weekly hours of work tasks 1–5, the pattern of tasks during work history was empirically determined by cluster analysis. Three clusters were identified: 1) low variation: the dentists who had spent most of their work time on restoration treatment and endodontics, 2) moderate variation: the dentists who had spent about half of their work time on restoration treatment and endodontics and another half on prosthodontics, periodontics and surgical treatment, and, 3) high variation: the dentists who had performed variable work tasks (Solovieva et al., 2006).

During the clinical examination session, weight was measured (without shoes) to an accuracy of 0.1 kg. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated based on self-reported height and measured weight. Information on weekly hours of hand-loading leisure-time activities and glove size was collected by a self-administered questionnaire. The customary glove size, graded as small, medium or large, was used as proxy for hand size. The hand-loading leisure-time activities were categorized into two groups using cluster analysis with the K-means algorithm. The majority of the subjects were classified into the low-level hand-loading leisure-time activity group (N = 390, 72%), while 28% of the women had high-level hand-loading leisure-time activity.

The differences in pinch grip strength between left and right hand by the level of variation in dental tasks and age groups were analysed applying generalized linear model with a repeated measures design. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the effect of age, the level of variation in work tasks and symptomatic hand OA on pinch grip strength. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adjusted for BMI, hand size, and hand-loading leisure-time activity. The analyses were performed with the SPSS (version 14.0 program).
