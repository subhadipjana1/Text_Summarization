->The aims of this paper were to describe ergonomics changes implemented in three meat cutting plants and to evaluate effects related to ergonomics on the individual meat cutters and their work
->The changes implemented consisted of reducing knife work to a maximum of 6h per day and introducing a job rotation scheme with work periods of equal length
->The questionnaire showed a reduction in perceived physical work load
->Improving meat cutters work Changes and effects following an intervention
->The second plant  cut both beef and pork in four departments on both day and night shifts
->The number of respondents from each plant is indicated in Table1
->The third plant  cut pork in three departments one of which also worked night shiftDifferent aspects of the working environment such as workplace and production layout manual lifting and work pace were observed and noted during the visits at each plant
->Of the multiplechoice questions three concerned attitudes to the new organization four concerned physical and mental work load and the rest compared the old work organization with the new one regarding aspects such as pauses work pace accidents and workplace design
->Temporary meat cutters from employment agencies at the company had to be excluded due to language problems and organizational difficulties
->Discussion and clarification of problems were made with relevant occupational categories on all levelsA questionnaire was developed comprising of 7 background 15 multiplechoice and 3 open questions concerning advantages shortcomings and any comments
->The questions used to assess physical and mental exertion were previously used by Engkvist All meat cutters  present on the day that the questionnaires were distributed had the opportunity to answer the questionnaire
->There were opportunities to ask the researchers present for clarification when filling in the questionnaireThe multiplechoice questions were analysed using descriptive statistics correlations between possible related answers and statistical tests
->Main changes were reducing knife work and job rotation
->Results showed a significant reduction in perceived physical work load
->There were some organizational and work load differences between the plants
-> and Madeleine and Madsen In all three plants less tiredness was experienced after the change Table2
->The improvement in perceived physical tiredness compared to the old way of working was significant
->At P the perceived improvement was less than at the other plantsThose working at B rated more tiredness both physically and mentally than the others
-> in all plants between 3 and 36 often or sometimes percieved difficulties in coping with their new tasks
->In the comments the responses referred to negative stressIn total 7175 gave an answer to these questions
->Comments such as You do not get as tired   were typical
->The result was a more sustainable production where three of seven supervisors found productivity lower but an improved yieldThe results from Table5                         indicate an overall trend in which occupational injuries and sick leave are reduced during the years following the intervention
->Platforms were difficult to adjustThe pork cutting department of BP consisted of three pace lines for ham side and shoulder
->Almost as many 77 gave their opinion from BP and from P 68 took the opportunity to give their view on the changes
->First 23 meat cutters cut the quarter carcass  letting chunks  fall down to a conveyor belt
->Next the other cutters had the chunks fall on their cutting table in random order
->The chunks were separated and sorted into for example bone fat and sirloin
->Platforms were individually adjustable for optimal working heightIn B meat cutting was conducted along a line where all meat cutters performed all tasks
->One heavy task was cutting off the whole loin section including the bone approximately 20kg lift it with one hand and carry it a few steps from the conveyor up  on the standing platform and place the meat on the table in front of the line
->The same method and weights applied to the fore shank and brisket
->Moreover there was a skinning department for manually and semiautomatically defattening ham cutting and packing
->The work stations included were those originally performed by the meat cutters
->Meat cutters at P were significantly less tired compared to B Table3
->These tasks involved handling and lifting meat details of smaller weights and with varied movement patterns
->These tasks were mainly demanding low skill others were controlling functions that were physically nondemanding
->It was closely monitored by the engineering department of the company to ensure that temperature didnt fall below12C and to certify that routines for crystallized fat were followed
->Here comments were on negative stress as working in an appropriate working height was troublesomeIn B 48 did not consider it practically feasible to adjust work height due to time constraints difficulties or no adjustment possibilities
->On a question of meaningfulness 40 saw no change while 21 perceived less meaning and 10 more meaningfulness in their work
->On the negative side most focused on the speed and pace of work such as I lose my flow when I have to change position
->On the night shift where work was similar to the day shift mainly temporary agency meat cutters worked
->Work periods of 6575min were organised with pauses and breaks of 1535min for food
->Here work was faster and lifting was sparseAt the P plant three departments were specialized in cutting one part of the pig each shoulder middle part and ham but one night shift cutting all parts
->Most meat cutters worked at the pace line where working conditions were similar to the pork cutting department of BPThus work load for beef cutters were highest at the BP plant and beef cutters as a whole had higher work load than pork cuttersIn all plants and departments pressurised purified air was blown into the membranes to separate the muscles before cuttingAll plants experienced similar change processes in how their steering committees were set with representatives from management trade union safety representatives and sometimes from the local occupational health services
->This together with monitoring quality was updated at least once a yearOther demands from the AV were addressed in the companys Safety Committees  A yearly medical examination was put into operation based on the recommendations by Ohlsson
->Independent expertise in the form of local OHS was employed in all plants to ensure that the requirements were met
->The plant with the largest portion of employees engaged in giving their opinion about the changes was B where 80 gave an opinion
->As can be seen from Table4 a number of meat cutters did not perceive any change The supervisors described the change process and the decisions as anchored in a democratic process with groups of employees and the union
->The work started in October 2008 for the plants except for B where the work started earlier and where the changes were implemented in September 2008
->Both BP and P managed to implement the changes before the deadline in December 2008In order to reduce the knife work to a maximum of 6h per day a rotation scheme was introduced
-> and performed by physiotherapists at each plants OHSTemperature has been discussed for many years
