->Next generation robotic manipulators are expected to resemble a humanlike behavior at kinematic level in order to reach the same level of dexterity of humans in operations like assembly of small pieces
->In this work we conjecture that making robots not only kinematically similar but also able to move and act in the same way as humans do might facilitate their social acceptance
->The analysis confirmed the hypothesis that a humanlike motion of the robot helps in facilitating social acceptance by reducing the perceived stress by humans in humanrobot coexistence
->Acceptability of robotic manipulators in shared working environments through humanlike redundancy resolution
->We organized this experimental campaign to address the problem of physiological stress during humanrobot coexistence
->The experiments are aimed at investigating the reactions of subjects to robot trajectories
->During the experiments no physical interaction with the robot is expected
->Their actual personal details except from the age were not recordedThe researchers then explained the purpose of the experiments reading the following text
->Particular attention was paid to minimize the effect of artifacts which might invalidate subsequent analysesFrom raw ECG data a filter was applied in order to recognize QRS complex and estimate the time instant corresponding to the R peak
->The measured skin conductance has been first resampled at 16Hz and then filtered with a Butterworth highpass filer of order 6 with a cutoff frequency
->The researchers prepared the volunteer attaching ECG EMG and SCR probes and checked their correct behaviour by asking the volunteer to contract three times the corrugator muscle
->The researchers then checked the correct alignment of the volunteer to the table and asked him to place his hands on the table and to get a comfortable and relaxed positionApproximately 180s of physiological data have been acquired before triggering the robot motion of which the last 10s will be regarded as baseline for subsequent analyses
->The total duration of the motion was approximately 120s while the total duration of one session  was about 10minNotice that each subject experienced the three redundancy resolution methods in different sequence in order to remove the possible effects of prior experiences of the robot motion which may influence and bias the measurements as pointed out in A short interview was finally taken to collect subjective impressions from the volunteer concerning the perceived safety naturalness of the robot motion and an estimate of the emotional state boredom anxiety etc
->Then the assemblylike task and the corresponding redundancy resolution were activated
->During each cycle the assembly task was repeated twice with the same redundancy resolution scheme
->Therefore the output signal is simply a train of pulses corresponding to the depolarization of the left ventricular which is responsible of the R peak in the ECG waveform
->The resulting discrete time signal updated at the end of each RR interval is usually called tachogram
->The HRV was then computed using a frequency domain analysis by means of the estimation of its PSDSince the portion of each experiment related to a particular redundancy resolution scheme is very short in time the tachogram was first resampled at 4
->Then following modern approaches in the analysis of the HRV signal see eg
->The PSD of HRV signal has been therefore estimated directly from the AR model coefficients  rather than applying the FFT  to the HRV signal
->It was first noticed that the level of noise measured during the baseline acquisition was significantly lower with respect to the one measured during the actual experiment
->Therefore in order to remove the noise the median of the entire acquisition was first measured and then removed from the acquired signal
->In particular the definition of statistics aimed at quantifying the robotinduced stress is explainedFor the ECG signal a common way to assess the dominance of the sympathetic nervous system with respect to the parasympathetic one is to measure the ratio between the power associated to the two corresponding bands of frequency
->which apart from some scaling factors corresponds from Parsevals theorem to the integrated PSD of the SCR over the frequency range
->report the boxplots of the normalized ECG and EMG statistics respectively
->In order to obtain a more rigorous verification of this conjecture the Pages ltest and the Jonckheeres trend test were computed for both the ECG and the EMG statisticsThe SCR statistics does not exhibit the same trend noticed for both the ECG and the EMG statistics and deserves a more detailed discussion
->For the SCR analysis we here make use of a different ordering of the three robot trajectories by using the average elbow elevation statistics
->The results of the two trend tests as well as of the KruskalWallis correlation analysis are reported in Table1
->Resolution of the kinematic redundancy in robotic manipulators inspired by human movements
->Assessment of physiological comfortdiscomfort as a function of the adopted redundancy resolution criterion
