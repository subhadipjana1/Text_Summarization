After participants provided consent and demographic data were collected, the researchers asked the participant to grasp seven pairs of various sized wooden dowels (one in each hand) to obtain grip diameter size preferences. Five hand measurements as defined in Greiner (1991) were obtained: digit 3 length, palm length, digit 3 height, hand breadth, and digit 1 link length. See Fig. 2
                        .

The order in which the participants interacted with the vehicles was counterbalanced to avoid confounds from order bias. Participants were instructed to sit in the driver's seat of the vehicle and adjust the seat and steering wheel to a comfortable position, while the researcher sat in the front passenger seat. The participants were asked to take a moment to become familiar with the car and steering wheel and then place their hands on the steering wheel in the most comfortable position. Hand placement was recorded on a spreadsheet by placing dots on a steering wheel outline, which corresponded with the participant's grip position. Next, each participant completed seven items about the steering wheel grip. The items from Nishina et al. (2006) were used (soft/firm, pliable/stiff, fitting/non-fitting, rough/smooth, luxurious/cheap, steady/slippery, comfortable/uncomfortable) and were rated on a 7-point Likert scale. One sample item was, “On a scale of ‘luxurious’ being 1 and ‘cheap’ being 7, how would you rate the steering wheel grip?” Next, each participant was asked to imagine two different driving scenarios (driving on a 5-h highway road trip at 112.7 km/h and driving while stuck in city traffic for an hour) and rate the comfort of that particular steering wheel using a 1-7 scale, where 1 = very comfortable and 7 = very uncomfortable. Finally, the participant was asked to rank grip preferences based on photos of the four vehicles' steering wheels. The “most comfortable” steering wheel grip was ranked one, while the “least comfortable” was ranked four.
