Physical activities involving trunk flexion are common among occupational and daily living tasks, particularly lifting, forward reaching and squatting. Epidemiologic studies have reported that tasks involving lifting with repetitive trunk bending and heavy loads pose risk factors for low back pain (LBP) (Hoogendoorn et al., 2000; Widanargo et al., 2011). Recent research has found LBP in adolescents to be more frequent than previously suspected (Burton et al., 2006). In Thailand, the prevalence of LBP among adolescent workers attributed to bending and reaching tasks was approximately 77% (Keawduangdee et al., 2012). These findings are in accordance with high LBP prevalence rates for workers in the USA and Switzerland (36 and 51%, respectively; Burton et al., 1996; Demoulin et al., 2007).

Trunk bending requires multi-joint coordination for lumbo-pelvic and hip movements as well as trunk muscle activation (Lee and Wong, 2002; Wong and Lee, 2004). However, if there is restriction of one of the multiple joints in the lumbo-pelvic and hip regions, this can result in altered movement and biomechanics of the remaining unrestricted joints (Yoo and Yoo, 2012). Tight pants, specifically sizes smaller than fit to a wearer's anthropometry, may restrict hip movement and alter trunk muscle activity during work tasks and leisure (Anders et al., 2005). Such clothing has become a popular clothing choice for Thai adolescents.

Previous research observed reduced hip mobility in association with increased spinal flexion and extension. This mobility limitation and spinal motion may be factors contributing to development of LBP (e.g., Dolan and Adams, 1993; Lee and Wong, 2002; Wong and Lee, 2004). In addition, based on the flexion–relaxation phenomenon (FRP), compensatory responses to hip mobility restriction are likely to decrease the supporting role of trunk musculature during full trunk flexion tasks (Anders et al., 2005). With respect to the FRP, McGill and Kippers (1994) reported apparent electromyographic silencing of lower back muscles during a standing to full trunk flexion maneuver. On this basis, it is hypothesized that lower back muscles decrease their supporting role (activation level) during full trunk flexion resulting from reflexogenic stimulation of stretch receptors in passive structures, specifically the posterior spinal ligaments (Solomonow et al., 1999; 2003a,b). Beyond this, with reference to the length–tension relationship theory, Aratow et al. (1993) reported that elongation of a muscle (with a focus on the lower back) can decrease the number of actin and myosin cross-bridges and subsequently decrease active force output. Therefore, EMG measured muscle activity decreases with elongation.

Changes in spine and hip mobility, and trunk muscle activations can lead to stresses at the lumbar motion segment, including altered loads and forces on spinal joints and the posterior spinal ligaments (Dolan and Adams, 1993; McGill and Kippers, 1994). Restricted and altered movement patterns of the hip and lumbar spine, respectively, may lead to low-back discomfort, which can ultimately be a cause of low-back pain and disability (Anders et al., 2005).

Historical workplace safety guidelines and regulations have addressed workers wearing loose clothing while operating machines and the potential for garments to become entangled in moving machinery parts (OSHA, 1992). Conversely, little, if any research, has focused on the impact of wearing excessively tight clothing at work, such as tight pants, on occupational illnesses for workers, such as LBP.

The objective of this research was to investigate the effect of wearing tight pants (smaller than fit sizes) on hip and lumbar spine movement, trunk muscle activity and perceived low-back discomfort in young adults. The study examined wearing tight garments as a cause of hip movement restriction in simulations of realistic work tasks in a lab environment. Specifically, we compared young adult lumbar range of motion, associated trunk muscle activity and low back discomfort (LBD) during box lifting, manual material handling (MMH) while squatting, and forward reaching while sitting on a chair. All tasks were performed by participants when wearing tight vs. fit (i.e., the correct size according to anthropometry) pants. The study was expected to complement prior research in the safety area by focusing on risks associated with wearing restrictive garments in work tasks vs. loose fitting clothing hazards.

We previously reported on a preliminary study (Eungpinichpong et al., 2012) of a similar nature involving a smaller sample size and no assessment of trunk muscle activity. The results of that study revealed an effect of restrictive garments on hip mobility and increased spinal flexion/extension. Preliminary discomfort ratings also revealed increases for the tight pants condition over fit pants. The research motivated the present investigation with a larger sample and assessment of muscle activity in conjunction with spinal motion and perceived discomfort.
