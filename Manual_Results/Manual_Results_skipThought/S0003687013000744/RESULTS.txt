The mean HRoM in flexion for tight pants was 87°, which was significantly less than for the fits pants with a mean HRoM of 103° (t = 4.2893, p = 0.0002). With respect to the HRoM in extension, the mean HRoM for tight pants was 21°, which was significantly less than for fits pants with a mean HRoM of 27° (t = 6.8474, p = 0.0001). A series of univariate ANOVA models were conducted on transformed muscle activity of RA, transformed muscle activity of ES, normalized LRoM and perceived low-back discomfort responses. A statistical model was initially constructed with five independent variables, including: 1) participant; 2) pants type; 3) order of pants; 4) task type; and 5) order of task, as well as an interaction term of pant and task types. Both order of pants and tasks did not have significant effects on any response measure so the order of participant exposure to conditions was dropped from the statistical models.

With respect to normalized LRoM, results revealed significant effects for both pant (p = 0.0004) and task type (p < 0.0001) (see Table 1
                      for statistical test information). In line with the hypothesis, the LRoM was higher when wearing tight pants than when wearing fit pants (Fig. 5
                     a). Post-hoc analysis using Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference tests revealed box lifting and squatting to produce significantly greater (p < 0.05) spinal flexion than reaching tasks (Fig. 5b). Statistical analysis also revealed no significant effect on interaction terms for normalized LRoM.

With respect to the normalized EMG responses, results revealed significant effects for both pant (p = 0.0246) and task type (p < 0.0001) on EMG ES. The EMG RA response only revealed a significant effect of task type (p < 0.0001; see Table 1 for test information). In line with hypothesis, ES muscle activity was significantly higher for participants when wearing fit pants (i.e., with less spinal flexion), as compared to tight pants (see Fig. Fig. 6
                     a). Post-hoc analyses revealed activation levels for both trunk muscles were significantly higher (p < 0.05) for participants when performing box lifting task followed by squatting and forward reaching, which were not different from each other (see Fig. 6b for EMG ES; Fig. 6c for EMG RA). There was no significant effect of the pants × task type interaction term on EMG ES or RA.

Significant effects for both pants (p < 0.0001) and task type (p < 0.0001) were also found for the subjective ratings of low-back discomfort (see Table 1). Results also revealed no significant effect of the interaction term on low-back discomfort. Conforming with expectation, VAS ratings were significantly higher for tight pants than fit (Fig. 7
                     a). However, contrary to the hypothesis, post-hoc analysis revealed participants to perceive squatting to cause significantly greater (p < 0.05) discomfort followed by lifting and reaching, which were not different from each other (Fig. 7b).
