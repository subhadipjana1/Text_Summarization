The first small in-depth sample was of six signal boxes where all lever weights were measured, postures and pulling strategies observed and signaller subjective ratings of weight/difficulty were taken for all the levers. Key results for this are summarised in Table 2
                        . The mean lever weight was 51.33 kg. However, in order to decide how to take the subsequent larger sample later the mean weight was not the issue but the range was, and particularly for the weights at the upper end of the distribution. Pull weights across the boxes varied from 8 kg to 155 kg, an enormous range reflecting the wide variety in lever system design and condition. The space in front of the levers within which the signaller must operate also varied widely, with some evidence that greater difficulty was experienced for similar lever weights when space was more limited.

Signallers were questioned about their perception of the weights of each lever they normally operated in a box, reporting these as heavy, medium and light without having sight of the actual measured weights. This was done for all signallers in the six boxes of the initial sample and for a number of others until we began to be confident with the findings; a total of 126 levers and signaller ratings were taken in this way. The perceptions of the signallers are quite indicative of the actual weights. By and large a signaller started to rate a lever as heavy at a measured weight of about 50 kg, with very few rated as light or medium above 60 kg (see Fig. 8
                        ). We suspected some influence of signaller stature and body size on the pulling strategies used (see below) and their ratings of lever weights. But there is no strong statistical evidence.

The large pre-screened (risk assessed) sample covered over 160 signal boxes. One or more levers, according to the pre-screening reports, were measured and operating behaviour and posture recorded for the usual signaller on that lever. The sample was almost entirely male (94% with 6% female), reflecting the workforce at that time. Average stature was 174.5 cm; 35% were judged to be of heavy build, 40% medium build and 25% light build.


                        Table 3
                         illustrates the type of results obtained, showing these for a random set of seven levers of the larger, pre-screened (risk assessed) sample. Data collected include three readings each for pull and push weights, their averages, strategy/posture adopted, basic data on the signaller and the distance to the operated element (signal or points). It must be remembered that measurements were only taken for those levers previously rated by the signallers and their managers as heavy or difficult, and so the general level of measured weights is much higher than for the first in-depth sample. These levers almost all have a mean, or at least a maximum, pull weight of 50 kg, confirming crudely the ability of signallers or their managers to judge the weight or difficulty of a lever and giving some credibility to thoughts of 50–55 kg as an initial alert (if not action) criterion level. Of around a thousand “heavy” levers across the 160 boxes only 30 were measured as being below 55 kg pulling weight for either maximum or mean (and only 13 below 50 kg for maximum). In total over 70 levers were measured at over 100 kg maximum pulling weight. The distribution of weight ranges for those levers measured as over 55 kg weight is summarised in Table 4
                        . Details for the 10 heaviest pull and 10 heaviest push lever weights are in Table 5
                        .

Push weights were found to be less than the pull weights, from marginally so to over 30% less. This is due to the mechanical construction of the links from the levers to the signals/points, and the mechanism of back weights employed.

In addition to the above, the frequency of operation was discussed with the manager and signaller; this varied from once a day or less to operation for every train, which could be 8 or 10 or more times per hour.

When assessing risk of musculoskeletal disorders in manual handling the postures adopted are as critical as the weights being moved. Moreover, since one of the aims of the research was to suggest training in improved lever pulling it was important to study and compare the different strategies and postures actually adopted by signallers, the variation in which had been pointed up by pilot work. Therefore in each box the investigators observed the lever pulling technique of the signallers who were on duty and recorded this. For the first boxes visited records were made via digital photography and video taping, but later when the team were more confident in distinguishing strategies and postures the recording was by eye with handwritten notes.

The postures adopted and the lever pulling strategies varied considerably. Observation and questioning led us to understand that the methods used depended on a combination of individual signaller preferences (perhaps influenced by the body size and weight of the individual), the space available to pull the lever in the signal box, design of the frame, the weight and position of the lever itself, and any previous injury or bad experience. The strategies have been described by us in three basic types: swing, drag and shuffle.
                           
                              a)
                              
                                 Swing method of lever operation starts with the signaller gripping the lever either with one or two hands, dependant on whether their approach is hindered by other levers already pulled over in the frame. Once the lever is released from the trigger catch in the frame there is a short pause in motion but grip is maintained on the lever. The arms are bent with the trunk of the body drawn in close to the lever and the body is then thrown backwards with the feet maintaining their position, and the back kept straight. The arms straighten until the weight of the lever is balanced against the force and weight of the body's backward movement (Fig. 9
                                 ). This movement appears to be dependant on the signaller's knowledge of the lever frame's idiosyncrasies.


                                 Shuffle method is similar to the swing method with a slight variation in the concluding part of the movement. The body mass cannot be accommodated under the lever's arc and therefore the signaller has to shift while the lever movement is coming to its end. This requires the legs to carry out a shuffling movement backwards in order to prevent collision between body and lever.


                                 Drag method starts as with swing and shuffle, but most often there is no pause or trigger release in its early stages. The signaller literally drags the lever through its arc of movement with the whole body moving back in synchronisation. The signaller's trunk gradually bends forward as the movement of the lever brings it towards them, ending with the signaller bent over the lever (Fig. 10
                                 ).

Across the whole sample, the swing method was used by 58%, drag by 25%, shuffle by 9%, and for 8% the posture/method was indeterminate.

When levers had to be returned to their normal position in the frame, signallers used one common method, which was mainly a reversal of the drag method. The pushing posture has to accommodate the arc of the lever, bending to get under the angle in order to gain the initial momentum.

Interviews carried out with the majority of signallers observed revealed the reported factors influencing their postures and pull/push strategies to be: weights to be operated; smoothness/roughness of the operation (caused by poor design or maintenance of the connecting wires or rods; tightness of wire adjustment; box design; space (or lack of it) in front of the levers; frame design (whether raised or not); general physical environment; age of signaller; build of signaller; general health of signaller; any previous injuries; previous experience of wire breaks (meaning a sudden change in force/weight); and any training received in operation (rare). Particular attention was paid to recording instances of where “jerk” forces could be required, where extra force is required to overcome initial inertia or if there is a snag or jam in the middle of the pulling or pushing action (HSE, 2004, clause 95).

For the purposes of the first biomechanics modelling of the lever pulling task, using JACK, it was assumed that the signaller pulled against a weight directly opposing the motion, and that this force acted through the signaller's palms. It was also assumed that each arm took half the total load (certainly an incorrect assumption in many cases but a decent approximation), and that gravity = 10 N/kg. Therefore for the weights modelled in the first phase, of 50, 80, 100 and 185 kg, the loads assessed were 500, 800, 1000 and 1850 N, crudely allocated as 250, 400, 500 and 925 N per arm. The potential lower back compression is given in Newtons within the JACK software; nominal risk of lower back injury for most healthy workers occurs at below 3400 N (the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Back Compression Action Limit); above 3400 N is defined as an increased risk of lower back injury for some workers and it is recommended that these jobs be modified to reduce lower back compression forces; and above 6400 there is an increased risk of lower back injury for most workers and it is recommended that the job should be re-engineered immediately to reduce the risk of lower back injury. The simulation results, giving the lower back compression in Newtons, are shown in Table 6
                         and in Fig. 11
                        .

It can be seen that the model predicts that the signaller is at a nominal risk of injury whilst operating levers of both up to 50 kg and also of 50–80 kg weight. Increased risk of injury is identified at 100 kg during stages 6 and 9 of the pull. Interpolating from Fig. 10 shows that the weight at which the level of risk increases is approximately 95 kg. The simulation of the heaviest recorded pull weight shows that the signaller is at increased risk of lower back injury throughout the pull, and this risk increases in severity at stage 6 for pulls over 175 kg. Fig. 11 can also be used to predict that the risk for most stages of the pull will not increase to a caution or alert level until a pull of around 118 kg is recorded.

In analysis of the data collected in the second modelling phase, using a wider range of body sizes and of pulling postures/strategies, the compression force was found to be 6900 N for a 5th%ile operator (male plus female) with 100 kg lever weight (Fig. 12
                        ). This is above the risk level for most workers of 6400 N. All compression forces for 80 kg and 100 kg weights and 50th and 95th%ile users were in the range 4100 to 6300 N, above the risk limit defined as relevant for some workers.

Injury and incident data were examined for 95 of the sites where measurements were carried out, to identify incidents leading to sickness absence which mention “lever” or “lever operation” or similar. A total of 272 incidents were recorded over a six month period (about 6 incidents per box per year). Most of the reports record circumstances as “whilst pulling (or pushing) lever(s)” and the injury site is generally back, neck, shoulders or abdomen, although the data made no distinction between chronic and acute injury. The total absence was 1628 days giving an average of six days sickness absence per incident, with a mode of 7 days and a range of 1–39 days. One estimate is that each day of absence incurs a cost equivalent to three days wages to the company, meaning a total annual cost of several millions of pounds in addition to the distress, inconvenience and worse caused to injured signallers.
