->These levers operate both points and signals and the risk is primarily the weights which have to be moved when pulling and pushing the levers
->Taken together with examination of injury and sickness absence data interviews and field observations and biomechanical computer modelling the measurement programme confirmed the potential risks
->A risk management programme has been implemented comprising lever weight measurement training of operations staff a structured maintenance regime and renewal or redesign for boxeslevers where after maintenance a criterion weight level is still exceeded
->A rolling risk assessment programme identified a number of levers in mechanical signal boxes within the UK rail network which potentially presented unacceptable personal safety risk to signallers
->Operating difficulties are often compounded by the design and condition of lever frames the linkages to the pointssignals maintenance regimes the workspace and the postures and strategies adopted by signallers
->Despite increased implementation of computer control systems in managing and regulating rail networks mechanical signal boxes using lever operation will be in place for years to come
->Management of personal safety risk for lever operation in mechanical railway signal boxes
->Thus there is some discrepancy in the various documents which make it difficult to determine which distance is most appropriate to use as a reference
->However there are considerable differences between lever pulling and the lifting and lowering tasks on which guidelines appear to be based and which are used as examples in the documentation
->Jerk forces used to loosen tight controls may be two or three times larger than the corresponding maximum steady forces forces which must be applied over a long period should it has been suggested not exceed 15 of the corresponding maximum force over 5s although some continuous application may last for much longer without rest In a variety of other studies risk factors have been identified  none for full length levers and mostly for cart or other moveable object pullingpushing or else from biomechanical modelling work
->It helped to justify the extension of the study to many boxes using design and development of a more sophisticated measurement deviceThe new measurement device was developed with the aim of assessing a much greater range of weights of the lever pullpush while allowing the signaller to operate the lever as close to normally as possible and not intruding on the signallers work
->Subsequently the ergonomists would discuss with the relevant staff the risk posed by the lever or levers and ways in which this risk might be mitigated in advance of the system being redesigned or replaced the topics covered were the pulling strategy used potential risk factors  precautions to be taken and the value of a full maintenance programmeLevers in over 160 additional boxes have been assessed in this main programmeData on lost time accidents due to lever operation were obtained from the companys safety management system and from human resources sickness records
->The device itself changed the way in which the signaller pulled the lever not a problem if the weights were likely to be consistent but in our case the multiple links between lever and moved object meant that the pulling action and effective weight would differ each time
->Three repeated measures were taken to allow the signaller to adjust to pulling the lever since the extra handle was slightly further forward than the normal lever and because of the natural variation in weight on each pull and push due to changes in the pulley or rodding systems and any slack or lack of which builds upAs outlined above the measurement programme has taken place in two phases each with a specific purpose
->Table1                         provides a summary of the information collected for two example leversboxesOnce it had been established from the first set of measurements that a potential problem existed for the company the measurement programme was extended across the Network Rail system of mechanical signal boxes in the most efficient manner possible
->The signallers were then asked to pull the lever and return  it three times using the attached lever as the handle
->This has come about due to them being often designed and built local to the area where they were installed many over 100 years ago
->The levers are used within the mechanical form of signalling which was developed during the 19th century to control the movement of trains
->Point operation is through connectivity of solid rodding bars  and so there is no slack in the system when pulling the lever
->This means that the full weight is experienced by the signaller from the start and throughout the entire pullWhilst the weight to be pulled  is the major factor examined in this study there are other potential hazards in the operation of the levers
->The requirements are in the companys own code of practice to which signalling engineers generally work but may be challenging and restrictive to achieve from an engineering point of viewThe question that arises is what is a safe lever weight or effort that an operator can exert given the nature of the task
->The former was at railway point switches but due to the much smaller size of levers this US work concentrated upon hand forces not on whole body movement and there are no lever frames nor other levers in close proximity to inhibit access their measured actions also start with the lever parallel to the ground with a lifting movement from a static position and no connectivity through wires or rodding
-> suggest that large levers used occasionally should have an operational force requirement of less than 190N They also find that improved pulling force is achieved with one foot off the ground
->Pulling and pushing forces are of the same magnitude whether the arms are held out sideways or forwards
->The amount of force a user can exert on a control depends on posture position and the length of time the force is applied
->The restricted space found in some signal boxes is likely to have some effects  for instance Lee  showed that restricting their space in front of the task reduced pushing strength by about 25Cart pushing and pulling is perhaps one of the tasks closest to lever operation in terms of the techniques used
->With levers the operator is pulling or pushing something which is supported by a superstructure and is only free to move in a single plane and in a fixed arc of motion
->Although rail signal box levers and frames all work on the same basic principles there are a large number of different frame and lever designs
->Although dated lever frame signalling is likely to be with us for a good while longer yet
->There are many variants of frame and lever types along with different release types
->Being a mechanical system the connections are prone to sudden failure often unexpected despite inspection routines and which could result in acute injury
->The rail industry does work to a number of Railway Group  Standards and Network Rail itself has standards and guidance which may go beyond the legal requirements
->The same authors generate design guidelines around limits on pull height and distance  a maximum pulling force for men of between 40lb and 150lb and for women of between 50lb and 90lb depending on height and distance
->The main focus of the modelling was to establish the possible changes in type and level of potential injury risk with different weights of lever pull and for different operating strategies and postures
->Relevant guidance states that The maximum recommended distance at which signals can be mechanically operated is 1000 yards which minimises the effects of temperature change on wire routes and elsewhere that wire operation of mechanical signals should be limited to 1000m
->They also find that improved pulling force is achieved with one foot off the groundReview papers covering a wide range of contributions to do with pullpush forces include Gallagher and Heberger  and Hoozemans
->The purpose of this phase was to establish the nature of the problem and collect a wide range of data to help develop criterion levels and to establish a basis for a first assessment and management programme
->This does not appear to follow recognised health and safety thinking and guidelines and regulations  but the lever systems have been around since long before current guidance was developed
->Originally signal boxes tended to be close to points in an attempt to lighten the weight of the pull but this is not always achieved
->First a small indepth sample was taken where all the levers in each box studied were assessed
->Then a much larger prescreened sample was visited where only levers previously identified as a problem by local staff were assessed
->Also it soon became clear that a capability to measure weights of over 100kg was required
->The data acquisition software loaded onto an attached laptop computer captured all the various measures on a time baseThe procedure in each box visited was as follows
->Also the long runs of the rods or chains through varying terrain means that they are prone to blockage through bank slides and the operator would have no way of knowing this until trying to take up the weightThe industry assessment of operability of levers with respect to their manageability is currently by reference to the length of the connection with no consideration given to weight of pull
->Maximum pulling force depends on height and distance of the pulled element and body weight and posture are of critical importance especially the stance for pulling
->Each lever movement had weight recorded at three locations through its path at the start of the pull during the middle of the pull and just prior to completion of the pull
->The connectivity between lever and the object to be moved gives some clue as to the differences in lever pull weightsFor signals the standard design is a wire connection from the tail end of the lever through a system of pulleys and detectors to a counter balanced weight fitted to the bottom of the signal post Fig
->The new instrument consists of a sleeve device with a strain gauge inside which fits over the range of lever handles attached to a copy handle which lies in the same plane a few centimetres away this allows the copy handle which is pulledpushed to be of normal lever diameter and by displacing it somewhat two people could pull the handle if the risk was thought to be a large one Figs
->We recognise that it would be very difficult to model in detail all the postures and pulling strategies used in practice for instance where these involved one foot being in the air for a while and also any sudden changes in the pulling motion during the range of motion which may increase risk though jerk forces therefore we treated all modelling work and analyses with cautionVideo recordings of the pulling strategies and postures  at a variety of boxes were used to build signaller lever pulling models representing a range of postures see Fig
->Development of an injury risk management plan for health and safety in lever operation
->Comparison of measured lever weights and subjective estimates of risk with biomechanical modelling estimates
->First published results on acceptable weightsforces for pulling long levers in rail mechanical signal boxes
->The signaller literally drags the lever through its arc of movement with the whole body moving back in synchronisation
->The simulation of the heaviest recorded pull weight shows that the signaller is at increased risk of lower back injury throughout the pull and this risk increases in severity at stage 6 for pulls over 175kg
->One estimate is that each day of absence incurs a cost equivalent to three days wages to the company meaning a total annual cost of several millions of pounds in addition to the distress inconvenience and worse caused to injured signallers
->The first small indepth sample was of six signal boxes where all lever weights were measured postures and pulling strategies observed and signaller subjective ratings of weightdifficulty were taken for all the levers
->However in order to decide how to take the subsequent larger sample later the mean weight was not the issue but the range was and particularly for the weights at the upper end of the distribution
->Pull weights across the boxes varied from 8kg to 155kg an enormous range reflecting the wide variety in lever system design and condition
->This was done for all signallers in the six boxes of the initial sample and for a number of others until we began to be confident with the findings a total of 126 levers and signaller ratings were taken in this way
->The sample was almost entirely male  reflecting the workforce at that time
->These levers almost all have a mean or at least a maximum pull weight of 50kg confirming crudely the ability of signallers or their managers to judge the weight or difficulty of a lever and giving some credibility to thoughts of 5055kg as an initial alert  criterion level
->Observation and questioning led us to understand that the methods used depended on a combination of individual signaller preferences  the space available to pull the lever in the signal box design of the frame the weight and position of the lever itself and any previous injury or bad experience
->Therefore for the weights modelled in the first phase of 50 80 100 and 185kg the loads assessed were 500 800 1000 and 1850N crudely allocated as 250 400 500 and 925N per arm
->The potential lower back compression is given in Newtons within the JACK software nominal risk of lower back injury for most healthy workers occurs at below 3400N  Back Compression Action Limit above 3400N is defined as an increased risk of lower back injury for some workers and it is recommended that these jobs be modified to reduce lower back compression forces and above 6400 there is an increased risk of lower back injury for most workers and it is recommended that the job should be reengineered immediately to reduce the risk of lower back injury
->This is above the risk level for most workers of 6400N All compression forces for 80kg and 100kg weights and 50th and 95thile users were in the range 4100 to 6300N above the risk limit defined as relevant for some workersInjury and incident data were examined for 95 of the sites where measurements were carried out to identify incidents leading to sickness absence which mention lever or lever operation or similar
->Most of the reports record circumstances as whilst pulling  lever and the injury site is generally back neck shoulders or abdomen although the data made no distinction between chronic and acute injury
->One or more levers according to the prescreening reports were measured and operating behaviour and posture recorded for the usual signaller on that lever
->The strategies have been described by us in three basic types swing drag and shuffle
->We suspected some influence of signaller stature and body size on the pulling strategies used  and their ratings of lever weights
->Average stature was 1745cm 35 were judged to be of heavy build 40 medium build and 25 light build                        Table3                         illustrates the type of results obtained showing these for a random set of seven levers of the larger prescreened  sample
->It must be remembered that measurements were only taken for those levers previously rated by the signallers and their managers as heavy or difficult and so the general level of measured weights is much higher than for the first indepth sample
->Swing method of lever operation starts with the signaller gripping the lever either with one or two hands dependant on whether their approach is hindered by other levers already pulled over in the frame
->This movement appears to be dependant on the signallers knowledge of the lever frames idiosyncrasies                                 Shuffle method is similar to the swing method with a slight variation in the concluding part of the movement
->The arms are bent with the trunk of the body drawn in close to the lever and the body is then thrown backwards with the feet maintaining their position and the back kept straight
->The arms straighten until the weight of the lever is balanced against the force and weight of the bodys backward movement Fig
->The signallers trunk gradually bends forward as the movement of the lever brings it towards them ending with the signaller bent over the lever Fig
