Lowerback injury from snow shovelling may be related to excessive joint loadingBased on these results it is concluded that the bentshaft snow shovel can likely reduce lowerback joint loading during snow shovelling and thus may have a role in snow shovelling injury preventionTherefore the purpose of this study was to compare L5S1 extension angular impulses between a bentshaft and a standard straightshaft snow shovelA standard motion analysis procedure was used to determine L5S1 angular impulses during each trial as well as peak L5S1 extension moments and peak upper body flexion angleResults of this study show that the bentshaft snow shovel reduced L5S1 extension angular impulses by 165  decreased peak moments by 118  and peak flexion by 130  compared to the straightshaft shovelInfluence of snow shovel shaft configuration on lumbosacral biomechanics during a loadlifting taskNearly 12000 individuals are treated in US emergency departments each year for snow shovellingrelated injuriesThe most common anatomical region for shovellingrelated injury is the lowerbackTherefore biomechanical design of an ergonomic shovel that can decrease these joint loads may have implications for lowback injury preventionPerhaps the most common ergonomic snow shovel that is available for purchase is the bentshaft shovel which includes a downward bend in the shovel shaft studied bentshaft shovels from a kinematic perspective and found that a bentshaft shovel significantly reduced upper body flexion when compared to the more common straightshaft shovelIt has been speculated that the decrease in upper body flexion associated with bentshaft shovel use would also decrease lumbar joint moments  however to the best of our knowledge no study to date has tested this hypothesisAlthough peak joint moments provide an instantaneous indication of the mechanical loads that occur at a joint they do not provide cumulative load informationRetroreflective markers were placed on each subjects feet shanks thighs pelvis and torso using a modified version of Vicons PluginGait marker set with additional medial markers at the ankle knee and hipSubjects positioned themselves with each foot on a separate Kistler force platform  and were then asked to shovel a 3kg sand bag at a selfselected speedTrials began when subjects initiated trunk flexion towards the floor to accept the load and trials ended once the shaft segment between both hands was parallel with the groundAs they shovelled seven Vicon MX13 cameras  recorded the 3D positions of each marker at a sampling rate of 200Hz while each force platform simultaneously sampled groundreaction force data at a frequency of 2000HzSubjects completed 5 trials with each shovel design in a randomly assigned order and were provided with a 1min break between each trial to prevent fatigueA neutral trial was also collected from each subject where the subject stood in the anatomical positionMarker and groundreaction force data were imported into Visual3D  and were smoothed using lowpass filters with cutoff frequencies of 10HzSegment lengths were then defined as the distance from the distal joint centre  to the proximal joint centreThese anthropometric data in combination with each subjects total body mass allowed for estimation of individual segment masses and moments of inertia Threedimensional joint kinematics for the ankles knees hips and the L5S1 joint were determined using a joint coordinate systemTotal upper body flexion was assumed to occur exclusively in the yz plane of the laboratory and thus upper body flexion angle was calculated in 2D relative to the vertical FigThis was done in MATLAB  by first defining the anteroposterior  and vertical  coordinates of a point H midway between the right and left hip markersH                            were equal to or less than zero an atan2 computational programming function was used to ensure correct angle calculationThe load was then dispatched to the left by rotating the shovel about its longitudinal axis instead of excessive load throwing common to snow shovellingThus this study made an attempt to isolate only the primary lifting movement associated with snow shovellingDetails concerning potential sources of errors associated with the processes described above are available elsewhereThe two designs compared were a bentshaft shovel and a straightshaft shovelL5S1 extension angular impulses were lower in the bentshaft conditionThis occurred due to reduced extension moment duration reduced extension moment magnitude and reduced upper body flexion4                      shows the mean upper body flexion angle curvesAdditionally the peak upper body flexion angle was reduced with the bentshaft shovel  FigSpecifically the bentshaft shovel reduced the L5S1 extension angular impulse by 165 compared to the straightshaft shovelTrialtotrial variability for extension impulse values for each subject was typically 15Total trial time was not significantly different between shovel conditions  however a trend existed Fig4 where extension moment duration was reduced with the bentshaft shovel Peak L5S1 extension moments were significantly reduced with the bent shaft shovel  Fig
