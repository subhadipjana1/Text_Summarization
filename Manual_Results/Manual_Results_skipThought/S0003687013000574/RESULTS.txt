There were some organizational and work load differences between the plants. At B&P, the beef cutting department had implemented a major change in working practices, as single table production was exchanged to a flow line with deboning in two stages to improve both work environment and production. First, 2–3 meat cutters cut the quarter carcass (∼80 kg), letting chunks (∼15 kg) fall down to a conveyor belt. Next, the other cutters had the chunks fall on their cutting table, in random order. This was mainly a non-lifting task. The chunks were separated and sorted into for example bone, fat and sirloin. Platforms were individually adjustable for optimal working height.

In B, meat cutting was conducted along a line, where all meat cutters performed all tasks. Quarters were cut down in two stages, but with manual and in some workplaces heavy handling. Quarters were cut hanging from a conveyor where working height was not adjustable. One heavy task was cutting off the whole loin section including the bone, approximately 20 kg, lift it with one hand and carry it a few steps from the conveyor, up (5–6 cm) on the standing platform and place the meat on the table in front of the line. The same method and weights applied to the fore shank and brisket. Platforms were difficult to adjust.

The pork cutting department of B&P consisted of three pace lines, for ham, side and shoulder. This work was fragmented into operations of less than 30 s and conducted at continuously moving conveyor belts. Work height could be adjusted and there was little lifting. A few single tables where meat cutters cut whole carcasses or large chunks were still used and many of the meat cutters had knowledge of working on the whole carcass. At single tables, manual handling and lifting weights of ∼10 kg was frequent. On the night shift, where work was similar to the day shift, mainly temporary agency meat cutters worked. Moreover, there was a skinning department for manually and semi-automatically de-fattening ham, cutting and packing. Here work was faster and lifting was sparse.

At the P plant, three departments were specialized in cutting one part of the pig each; shoulder, middle part and ham, but one night shift cutting all parts. The production method was a mix of pace line and separate tables where some meat cutters biweekly worked either method. Most meat cutters worked at the pace line where working conditions were similar to the pork cutting department of B&P.

Thus work load for beef cutters were highest at the B&P plant, and beef cutters as a whole had higher work load than pork cutters.

In all plants and departments, pressurised purified air was blown into the membranes to separate the muscles before cutting.

All plants experienced similar change processes in how their steering committees were set with representatives from management, trade union, safety representatives and sometimes from the local occupational health services (OHS). There were plant-specific committees and an overall company project steering committee. A large number of meetings were held until consensus was obtained. The work started in October 2008 for the plants, except for B, where the work started earlier, and where the changes were implemented in September 2008. Both B&P and P managed to implement the changes before the deadline in December 2008.

In order to reduce the knife work to a maximum of 6 h per day, a rotation scheme was introduced. Work periods of 65–75 min were organised with pauses and breaks of 15–35 min for food. The longer the work period, the longer the pause. The work stations included were those originally performed by the meat cutters. The additional tasks for rotation were mostly among the meat packers, such as skinning details at skinning machines, and packing at different vacuum packaging machines. These tasks involved handling and lifting meat details of smaller weights and with varied movement patterns. These tasks were mainly demanding low skill; others were controlling functions that were physically non-demanding. The result meant job enlargement within the department to tasks additional to meat cutting. For the individual, this meant five work periods a day, one of which was without using a knife. To manage the rotation scheme, a personal competence development plan was set up for each meat cutter. This, together with monitoring quality, was updated at least once a year.

Other demands from the AV were addressed in the company's Safety Committees (SCs): A yearly medical examination was put into operation, based on the recommendations by Ohlsson et al. (1994) and performed by physiotherapists at each plant's OHS.

Temperature has been discussed for many years. It was closely monitored by the engineering department of the company, to ensure that temperature didn't fall below +12 °C and to certify that routines for crystallized fat were followed. Independent expertise in the form of local OHS was employed in all plants to ensure that the requirements were met. They reported to the company's SC.

The meat cutters employed in the three plants participated in this study, see Table 1.

Most meat cutters were men. All but two women were found in workplaces with physically less demanding handling and lifting tasks such as skinning and ham deboning.

The age distribution was fairly even but with some overrepresentation of younger (<32 years) cutters, and cutters around 50 years being underrepresented.

The meat cutters were in general experienced. In B all but one, in B&P all but four and in P all were fully experienced (one year according to Häkkänen et al. (2001) and Madeleine and Madsen (2009)).

In all three plants, less tiredness was experienced after the change (Table 2
                           ). The improvement in perceived physical tiredness, compared to the old way of working was significant. At P, the perceived improvement was less than at the other plants.

Those working at B rated more tiredness, both physically and mentally, than the others. Meat cutters at P were significantly less tired compared to B (Table 3
                           ).

All perceived more physical than mental tiredness.

There was a considerable difference between the plants regarding perception of rest during breaks. The meat cutters of B&P (Table 2) perceived significantly better rest at breaks than the meat cutters of the two other plants.

Many meat cutters worked frequently at work stations not suited for their body height. Between 35 and 69% did this at least sometimes (Fig. 1
                           ). Here, comments were on negative stress as working in an appropriate working height was troublesome.

In B, 48% did not consider it practically feasible to adjust work height due to time constraints, difficulties or no adjustment possibilities. For P this figure was 33% and for B&P 16%. (Fig. 2
                           ).

Whether rotation meant working on tasks they found difficult (Fig. 3
                           ), in all plants between 3 and 36% often or sometimes percieved difficulties in coping with their new tasks. At B, most of the meat cutters (68%) and in B&P 66% experienced no problems. Safety.

At B and at P, a large majority perceived the accident risks unchanged. In B&P 50% saw it as unchanged (Fig. 4
                           ). In the comments, the responses referred to negative stress.

In total, 71–75% gave an answer to these questions. Of those who answered, most perceived their work as remaining unchanged. About 40% did not perceive any change in the use of their skill. The support and help from, and cooperation and contact with workmates showed the same figures. After the changes 50% perceived the same support and help from their supervisors as before. Variation in work was more or less the same: 29% did not perceive a change while 20% had more monotonous and 21% more varied work. On a question of meaningfulness, 40% saw no change while 21% perceived less meaning and 10% more meaningfulness in their work. Regarding freedom at work, 39% saw less freedom and 24% saw a worsening of conditions.

On the question of whether still working for the company in three years, 40% answered yes and 7% no, while 25% did not know. For 48% of them, the changes had not affected their willingness to work as a meat cutter. For 14% willingness had decreased and for 8% it had increased.

In the open ended questionnaire answers (Table 4
                        ), the respondents expressed their view on their work and the changes. The plant with the largest portion of employees engaged in giving their opinion about the changes was B, where 80% gave an opinion. Most of their responses were positive (54%). Almost as many, 77% gave their opinion from B&P, and from P 68% took the opportunity to give their view on the changes. There were a total of 384 opinions and suggestions, 57% of which were positive and 38% negative. A t-test showed a significantly larger number (<0.001) of positive answers from plant B. The figures for the two other plants were not significant. Opinions given were to a certain extent identical. There were many comments on the physical side of the work. Variation and diversity, as well as being less physically strenuous, were experienced as positive outcomes of the new way of working. Comments such as “You do not get as tired (physically)” (81 comments), were typical. On the negative side, most focused on the speed and pace of work, such as: “I lose my flow when I have to change position” (22 comments). As can be seen from Table 4, a number of meat cutters did not perceive any change (20 comments).

The supervisors described the change process and the decisions as anchored in a democratic process with groups of employees and the union. They considered the rotation positive as the work load on the individuals was more even and the physical load decreased, resulting in less pain. Rotation had increased competence in the departments. For production, there was a ramp up period with some practical difficulties, eventually solved. The result was a more sustainable production where three of seven supervisors found productivity lower, but an improved yield.

The results from Table 5
                         indicate an overall trend in which occupational injuries and sick leave are reduced during the years following the intervention.
