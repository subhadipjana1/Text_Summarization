                           Height was significantly correlated with grip diameter preference and 3.2Â cm was the most popular.


                        
                        
                           
                           Hand placement was correlated with height, with shorter adults using an asymmetrical grip.


                        
                        
                           
                           Hand placement location varies by vehicle and age group.


                        
                        
                           
                           Future research should consider more controlled conditions and simulator or on road studies.
