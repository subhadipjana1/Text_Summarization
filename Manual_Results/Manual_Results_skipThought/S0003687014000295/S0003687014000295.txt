->Recommendations for future work in steering wheel grip design and naturalistic driver hand positioning are discussed
->While much research exists on occupant packaging both proprietary and in the literature more detailed research regarding user preferences for subjective ratings of steering wheel designs is sparse in published literature
->In this study participants selected their preferred grip diameter responded to a series of questions about the steering wheel grip as they sat in four vehicles and rank ordered their preferred grip design
->Drivers demonstrated different gripping behavior between vehicles and between groups
->Evaluation of four steering wheels to determine driver hand placement in a static environment
->The most comfortable steering wheel grip was ranked one while the least comfortable was ranked four
->The participants were asked to take a moment to become familiar with the car and steering wheel and then place their hands on the steering wheel in the most comfortable position
->Next each participant completed seven items about the steering wheel grip
->One sample item was On a scale of luxurious being 1 and cheap being 7 how would you rate the steering wheel grip Next each participant was asked to imagine two different driving scenarios  and rate the comfort of that particular steering wheel using a 17 scale where 1very comfortable and 7very uncomfortable
->Five hand measurements as defined in Greiner  were obtained digit 3 length palm length digit 3 height hand breadth and digit 1 link length
->After participants provided consent and demographic data were collected the researchers asked the participant to grasp seven pairs of various sized wooden dowels  to obtain grip diameter size preferences
->The order in which the participants interacted with the vehicles was counterbalanced to avoid confounds from order bias
->Height was significantly correlated with grip diameter preference and 32cm was the most popular
->Hand placement location varies by vehicle and age group
->Future research should consider more controlled conditions and simulator or on road studies
->Baby Boomer and GenerationY adults sat in four vehicles and chose their preferred hand placement
->Hand placement was correlated with height with shorter adults using an asymmetrical grip
->It should be noted that when testing for mean differences using the T or F statistic if homogeneity was violated the Satterthwaite approximation was usedTo compare the Baby Boomers and GenerationY groups independent samples t tests were conducted on the participants hand measurements body height and preferred dowel size
->Because there were no significant differences between groups for the hand measurements and body height the groups were combined and a correlation matrix was calculated to examine relationships between the hand and body height measurements and dowel size preference
->Hand measurements body height and dowel size preference were compared between groups
->A total of five participants  indicated in at least one vehicle that the most comfortable way to grip the steering wheel was with only one hand
->Participants who exhibited any of the atypical hand placement locations  were separated into one group and compared to participants who placed both hands symmetrically on the top of the steering wheel
->Drivers with atypical hand placement were grouped and compared to typical hand placement with t testsGrip design was assessed using rank orders of the four steering wheels and Likert scales were correlated between groups and between vehicles
->Five  of the 32 participants used an asymmetrical hand arrangement on at least one vehicle
->Two of those five had an asymmetrical hand arrangement on more than one vehicle
->Neither the hand measurements nor dowel size preferences were significantly different between groups but body height was significantly different t2285 p005
->GenerationY ranked the BMW 530XI as more cheap than Baby Boomers t2181 p05
->GenerationY ranked the Mazda2 as more soft than Baby Boomers t2374 p05
->In past studies that investigated driver hand placement in a naturalistic setting no anthropometric data were measured
->One of these participants used a mixed configuration where one hand was on the top of the wheel and the other on the bottom of the wheel where the left hand was on the lower half of the wheel and the right hand on the top half
->Participants who gripped the steering wheel in a manner that was not symmetrical and on the top part of the wheel were significantly shorter  in body height than participants who gripped the wheel symmetrically on top Referencing photographs of vehicle steering wheels participants were asked to rank order the steering wheels from most preferred  to least preferred
->Hand placement was compared across vehicles and groups with descriptive data using the same categories as Jonssons study
->GenerationY participants ranked the Mazda RX8 as first preference  more than Baby Boomers
->There were no significant differences between the GenerationY and Baby Boomer groups for all other rankingsVehicle steering wheels were compared using the seven Likert scale ratings
