->The various PNLs affected only the trunk angle  but had significantly positive  and negative  correlations with the subjective discomfort rating for perineum and ischial tuberosity respectively
->When the participants were seated at PNL0 or 3cm cycling using dropped handles was less stable compared with using straight handles however the handle height did not affect the cycling stability when the PNL was 6cm
->This study examined body posture subjective discomfort and stability requiring the participants to ride a stationary bicycle for 20min  using various combinations of two handle heights and five seatprotruding node lengths
->The results suggest that a 6cm PNL is the optimal reference for bicycle seat designs
->Optimal protruding node length of bicycle seats determined using cycling postures and subjective ratings
->Richmond  and Matheny  indicated that handlebars that are set too low can induce compression neuropathy and certain overuse symptoms as well as irritation of the labia in female cyclists and of the prostate in male cyclists
->However they increase the pressure on the perineal and groin regions causing riders to extend their torsos far backward when cycling
->This may be because it is simple to slip off a seat that lacks a protruding node  however this is unacceptable by riders
->Chen and Yeh  have observed that the subjective discomfort rating for the buttocks area is relatively higher than those for the other parts of the body
->Bressel and Larson  also determined that most riders felt that the seat was uncomfortable
->Previous studies have primarily focused on riding efficiency  handlebar heights  and frame size
->In recent years the focus of bicyclerelated research has gradually shifted to seat  design
-> surveyed 900 cyclists determining that 36 of men and 42 of women complained about their bicycle seat
->Another study examining 453 cyclists showed that the most frequently mentioned complaints were saddle sores  and more women than men experienced discomfort when riding a bicycle or when seated on a saddle Previous studies on bicycle seats have primarily focused on analyzing traditional seats that exhibit protruding nodes  or analyzing the seat pressure distribution for various commercial seats
->Some riders have quit cycling because of unbearable discomfort or harm caused by bicycle seats The contact between the seat and the buttocks is a critical cause of discomfort and pain
->In addition to PNL the design variables for bicycle seats vary substantially and have not been thoroughly researched in previous studies causing the understanding of the effect of PNL on riding posture and subjective ratings to be limitedIn this study we hypothesized that an optimal PNL may exist for traditional seats furthermore seats involving protruding nodes that enable maintaining a proper degree of body stability reducing discomfort in the perineal region and guiding the trunk to bend forward during riding thereby lightening the load on the ischial tuberosity
->In the experiment we collected data regarding the body postures of riders subjective discomfort ratings and cycling stability after the participants rode a bicycle for 20min using various handle heights and seat PNL combinations to identify the optimal PNL
->At the end of each ride the subjective discomfort for various body parts and stability rating scores were immediately selfreported by the participants
->The participants repeated each experimental combination twice on distinct days thus the reliabilities between the trials were analyzed for each dependent variable
->In addition a Pearson productmoment correlation was used to explore the PNL and subjective discomfort rating values and the testretest reliabilities
->Prior to the experiment the participants warmed up for 5min to acclimate to the cycling tests
->To simulate cycling the participants viewed a screen positioned approximately 5m in front of them at eye level while cycling and repeated the information on the screen  to confirm that they received this information
->Each participant adjusted the seat to the most comfortable height  and the preset seat height was determined by referring to NordeenSnyder  who suggested that the seat height was set to 100 of the riders trochanteric leg length
->The experimenter then established the handle height based on the height of the seat surface
->The statistical significance level was set at 005 and each participant was considered a block
->The 16 participants simulated cycling for 20min for each of 10 test combinations 5 seat PNLs
->During testing the participants pedaled the stationary bicycle at a resistance equivalent to a power output of 120W at a cadence of 60rpm
->A calibration frame  was used to construct a validated 2D plane by using the motion system yielding measurement errors within 05
->No previous study has systematically examined the effects of protruding nose lengths
->We collected body postures and subjective ratings under 5 seat PNLs2 handle heights conditions
->When PNL6cm discomfort was more acceptable and stability was also sufficient for the riders
->Different PNLs affected only the trunk angle and did not affect the other body angles
->The handle and the PNL variables had varying effects on the degree of pelvic tilt
->In the table dropped handles caused a high subjective discomfort rating value for the neckshoulders wrists and lower back
->In addition the table also indicates that dropped handles caused poor stability                         Table4                         indicates that different PNLs affected only the TA  and did not affect the other body angles
->The intraclass correlation coefficient  values for the reliabilities between the repeated trials performed on distinct days ranged from 087 to 096  for each dependent variable among the 16 participantsThe ANOVA results indicated that handle heights  significantly influenced cycling posture as shown in Table2
->When the PNL was shortened the torso had a greater anterior tilt angle within a range from 380  to 441
->Regarding stability the participants indicated that short PNLs  were significantly less stable  than were long PNLs
->Because the test simulated a normal sight level during riding when the torso tilted forward a greater HE was required
->In other words lower handles caused the torso to lean forward in addition to pelvic anterior rotation additional spinal curvature  was required for cycling                        Table3                         shows the ANOVA and Duncan test results for the effects of handle variables on the subjective discomfort and stability scores
->The results showed that the PNL had significantly positive and negative correlations with the discomfort scores of the perineum  and ischial tuberosity  respectively
