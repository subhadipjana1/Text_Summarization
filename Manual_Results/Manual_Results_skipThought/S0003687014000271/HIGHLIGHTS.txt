                           We collected body postures and subjective ratings under 5 seat PNLs ×2 handle heights conditions.


                        
                        
                           
                           Different PNLs affected only the trunk angle, and did not affect the other body angles.


                        
                        
                           
                           The handle and the PNL variables had varying effects on the degree of pelvic tilt.


                        
                        
                           
                           When PNL = 6 cm, discomfort was more acceptable and stability was also sufficient for the riders.
