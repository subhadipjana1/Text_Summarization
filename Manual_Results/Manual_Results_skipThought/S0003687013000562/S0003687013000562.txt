We report a study which aimed to provide further development and refinement of a set of guidelines  for the design and evaluation of warning signs and other visual material for young childrenWe discuss our findings within the context of a revised set of guidelines and a set of suggestions aimed at working towards a more comprehensive approach to the designevaluation of signs for young childrenThe paper concludes with a set of future topics for research including a discussion of ways forward in terms of improving support for design and evaluation including behavioural testing with children their parents and other care giversThe development of guidelines for the design and evaluation ofwarning signs for young childrenThese stages were common to both the semistructured interviews and the focus groupsFollowing briefing and obtaining study consent from participants interviewees were asked a set of questions regarding their previous experience with childrens safety and warning signsQuestions probed what signs participants were aware of where they had seen these and their purposeIn addition interviewees were asked about the specific features of signs and warning which they considered to be important as part of the content and general design of safety signs and warningsStage 2 involved participants evaluating each of the design guidelines developed by WatersonParticipants were then shown a set of signs currently in use within the UKIn addition participants were also shown examples of the signs which were developed as part of the WatersonA final set of codes for the interview and focus groups emerged out of these discussionsIn general participants showed a good deal of awareness of locations and places where they had encountered warning signs for childrenExamples included outdoor centres swimming pools traffic signs and labels on products and packagingThe question of whether to show examples of good and bad behaviour in the same sign generated some discussion amongst participantsOne observation which cropped up a number of times was that evaluation should be seen within a wider context and not simply restricted to warning signs2a and b without knowing more about the contextAdditional materials such as videos photographs multiplechoice tests were also suggested as ways of complementing role playing and storytellingThe inclusion of rewards and incentives was also thought to be worth considering A number of additional points were made including the comment that the guidelines assume a relatively passive role for children in the evaluation activitiesThe prime purpose of Stage 1 was to generate information about childrens signs without a feeling of being constrained by the guidelines developed earlier or prompted by current signs shown to them later5                         for example shows an of the sign language symbols used in the Makaton system The importance of keeping uptodate with trends and changes was also stressed alongside the importance of using characters and images which were immediately recognisable and identifiable theres not a child on the planet that cant spot the M in the McDonalds and the tick  you dont even need the word for Nike because you have the tick A number of participants stressed that young children vary a great deal in their ability to comprehend information  and that designing for the age group 511 needs to take these factors into account My children are starting to recognise words like cat dog that kind of wordA small child might just simply think that is someone running to catch the train or dancing The guideline addressing fonts and lettering 3v received the most criticism from participants and discussing the strengths weaknesses and suggestions for improvements for each guideline and discussing the strengths weaknesses and suggestions for improvements for each guidelineThis process followed the guidelines outlined by Miles and Huberman  and aimed to establish consistent coding schemesThese types of considerations underlined the need to avoid language as much as possible when considering the components of visual signsIn general there was support for the design guidelines  however a number of participants felt that more details could be included and some modifications were neededAs a person that does research work I would already know that In other cases it was felt that these guidelines had value but needed to be extended and complemented by an overview of the design lifecycle and an indication of where each guideline applied to stages in the lifecycle it would be useful to almost have a flowchart  this is how you go about developing   it would be helpful if they were put in sequenceIt was also pointed out that the design of signs and other visual material for children is often a team effort and that more specific guidance linked to design lifecycles phases etc might help to establish continuity between team members over time and handover between different specialists within the teamOne of the central questions was the intended audience of the guidelines and the need to tailor their content to this audience Who are the guidelines for Id expand some of those statements to be a little more prescriptive A similar comment from one of the illustrators was that the need to set the guidelines within a design context where designers often worked under a great deal of time and budgetary pressureThe guidelines needed to be more direct punchier and tailored to the daytoday working world of the illustrator or designer You need to be able to glace at something once and understand   you dont stop to read things when you are a designerThis comment was reinforced by other groups who had experience in designing safety signs for trains youve got to make it so the designer can do their job  Its about getting that process to be concise and quick enough and easy enoughOne way of achieving this was to attempt to either simulate the context or carry out evaluation in situ Couldnt you try and set up a train or something like that with the doors  youd invite children in to a mockup train station with the trainThe role of storytelling featured in some participants comments  particularly as a means of establishing some context for the sign you would start a conversation about whose ever been on a train who knows about different trainsIn addition participants were asked about their ideas and suggestions for methods for evaluating warning signs and other visual information for young childrenAll of the interviews and focus groups were recorded using a digital recorder and manually transcribed into Microsoft Word documentsTemplate analysis  was used to further examine and develop codes using a set of a priori codes based upon the interview and focus group questions and the design and evaluation guidelinesDuring the second phase of data analysis the original codes were reanalysed and a number of additional themes and subthemes emerged from the dataThe codes were developed independently by both authors and then compared and discussedRecall of the details of specific signs proved harder howeverSome participants were able to describe in detail signs designed to encourage hygiene  and safe behaviour on playgrounds4                         shows a tag cloud of these suggestionsSome participants emphasised the need for colours to build on the natural associations children have with the circumstances they associate with danger and hazards  whilst others stressed the need for colours to use a limited set of colours rather than make signs too busyI would then go out I would probably find someone who has children from a friend group Guideline 2i  was viewed as being helpful but in need of expansion and positioning in a larger context Signage should be developed in association with the environmentproductequipment you are developing so that it matches what the gaps are2c in order illustrate the way in which misunderstandings might occur with younger children  that doesnt show the gap does itMany felt that showing bad behaviour might encourage children to try out the action in the sign Some  would think look theres the bad behaviour I hadnt thought about it lets go do that  look what I can do I can swing off the rails rather than oh look I can sit sensibly on the train Guidelines 4iii  4iv  and 4v  received support from participantsSome of the characters shown on the signs developed in our earlier work involved the use of monsters and gargoylesThese were seen to be potentially frightening to very young children and it was recommended that they be replaced with friendly charactersAt the same time it was acknowledged that the types of evaluation carried out within the guidelines might be difficult with young children  but might work with older children A second set of comments related to the need to underline the importance of the context in which the signs would be positioned located and usedActing out the roles either in the classroom or a real situation  and possibly asking teachers or parents to dress up and make the activity fun to children was also mentioned It might be worth considering someone who is an actor who could may be portray different roles being a train guard or whatever situationThe most frequently used words to answer this question were colour  character  simple  and understandattentionA common observation was the need to be aware of the prevalence of colour blindness and the problems involved in using some colour combinations The use of characters cartoons and other pictorial material was mentioned a number of times during the interviews and focus groupsOne participant  emphasised that younger children respond better to animal characters as compared to older children who are more likely to identify with characters representing children or adultsThe description of the process of illustrating a childrens book showed that much of the process the illustrator used was relatively adhoc illstructured and informal I would normally target it with 2 or 3 friends just around the house just very quickly whats thatOne of the participants mentioned a book which shows examples of signs  which can be read by preschool children before they have been formally taught to read Guidelines 3iii  and 3iv  elicited a number of comments inline with those described in Section 31The need for one glance understanding  and the avoidance of relying solely on words was emphasised I would imagine your first objective would be to avoid words altogether it may not be possible it all depends on what you are trying to put over and sayUppercase may work with signal words such as STOP but the use of bold and exclamation marks were preferred for emphasisA final set of comments emphasised the need to treat young children with respect and not to patronise them I would make sure that you talk to them like a real person dont talk down to them    Children are very quick to take offense and children always believe they are older than they areThe evaluation involved interviews and focus groups with parents teachers human factors experts and other groupsThe paper concludes with a set of recommendations for future work
