                           Experimental campaign on volunteers to gather physiological signals.


                        
                        
                           
                           Assessment of physiological comfort/discomfort as a function of the adopted redundancy resolution criterion.


                        
                        
                           
                           Human-like movements of the robot alleviate the stress during human-robot coexistence.


                        
                        
                           
                           Non human-like movements are responsible for a more stressful affective state of humans.
