Upon entering the lab, participants completed an informed consent document and demographic questionnaire, which included visual acuity, color vision deficiency, and driving experience. Prior to beginning the study, participants' visual acuity was examined using the Snellen Eye Chart. Those who met the minimum visual acuity standard (20/20) were allowed to continue on to the experiment. Participants participated in both the preference test and the glance legibility test. The preference test was always performed first. Participants were not timed; they were given sufficient time to determine their preferences and describe their reasoning.

In the glance legibility test, participants were required to sit in a fixed position. The distance between the LCD monitor and the participant's position was 20 ft (600 cm), which was designed to replicate 20/20 visual acuity with mid-sized symbols in the 5 sizes. To remove potential distractions, all non-related objects in the experimental space were covered with white sheets. Each symbol was displayed for one second on the LCD monitor, and between displays, an abstract roadway image was displayed in order to remove any iconic memory within the eye. After projection of each display, participants were asked to identify the same symbols using reference card. The order of the 10 symbols was randomized progressively by size, beginning with the smallest series of 10 symbols, and transitioning to the next series of larger symbol size. Half of the participants examined the positive contrast format first (white on green), while the other half tested the negative contrast format first (black on yellow). The average time required to complete the experiment was approximately 60 min.
