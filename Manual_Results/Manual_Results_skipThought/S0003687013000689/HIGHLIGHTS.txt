                           The alternative designs (animate symbol) performed better in both the preference test and the glance legibility test.


                        
                        
                           
                           The alternative designs (animate symbol) showed better conceptual compatibility for bicycling facility signs.


                        
                        
                           
                           The alternative designs (animate symbol) were more legible than the current sign (inanimate symbol).
